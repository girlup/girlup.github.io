    <span class="card-title">Fundraising Plan</span>
    <p>Since our campaign aims to invest extensive efforts into our online presence on social media sites, we expect to receive about $80 million from online donations. In addition to promoting contributions from our supporters, our campaign will be in contact with various political organizations whose focuses align with those from our campaign. Organizations such as the Service Employees International Union and America Votes that promote issues aligned with our party platform can be excellent sources for our campaign donations. To aid these supporter donations, our campaign plans to conduct fundraising events that are centered around specific issues. Throughout the general election time, our campaign will host 6 fundraising events based on the important issues from our campaign. Specifically these issues are: The national debt, Education, Computer Privacy and Net Neutrality, Terrorism, Climate Change, and Immigration.</p>
