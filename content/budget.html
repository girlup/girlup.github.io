    <p>Maintaining our campaign finances, our legal issues, and our fundraising efforts requires a Legal &amp; Fundraising department to work to ensure that the campaign can properly function.

    <p>A 30 second TV ad will be aired on popular national tv networks 40 times per day in the 4 days leading up the election and on Election Day. This concentration of advertisement for our campaign in the days before the election will hopefully help garner up a significant amount of support needed on Election Day.</p>

    <span class="card-title">Poll</span>
    <p>Our campaign will be working with a polling firm to conduct a 5 question survey in 13 different states: Colorado, Nevada, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina,  California, and Texas. The reason why we are having our poll conducted in these states is because most of these states are somewhat equally Democratic and Republican with the exception of California and Texas. Getting data on voter ideas and feelings on various political issues can help our campaign adjust our strategies in those states in order to gain support. If our campaign gains strong support in these toss-up states, hopefully on Election Day, voters from these states can show up and help our campaign succeed. In addition, polling strongly partisan states like California and Texas can give our campaign data on the firm political beliefs from both sides of the political spectrum. This data will also help our campaign develop effective strategies and policies that can help win support over individuals in these states as well. </p>

    <span class="card-title">Field</span>
    <p>Having an efficient and effective field department is critical if our campaign wants to build an extensive network of support across the country for our campaign. Hiring individuals for numerous positions will help our campaign efficiently manage organization efforts in all 50 states. To oversee the management of all campaign operations in each state, a State Chairperson will be hired in each state to act as a representative leader for our state campaign efforts. In addition, a State Finance Chairperson will be hired in each state to oversee all campaign financial operations and management in that state. Our State Policy Directors in each state will work with our field coordinators and volunteers to assess our campaign strategies and proposed policies. Determining how a state reacts to a proposed policy from our campaign can help us improve on our proposed policies and help us develop new strategies to use in order to get more support from that state’s voters. A State Communications Director in each state will oversee all campaign communication efforts in that state. This includes management of media advertising, campaign events, and other ventures for campaign promotion. A State Deputy Volunteer Director in each state will oversee management of all volunteer efforts conducted in that state. In addition, Volunteer Coordinators in each state will be tasked with recruiting, scheduling, and retaining our campaign volunteers. State Scheduling Coordinators in each state will schedule campaign events in that state in coordination with our schedulers from our national campaign.
  Since our campaign aims to conduct extensive efforts in all 50 states, hiring Field Organizers in each state to organize various campaign efforts such as Get Out The Vote efforts will enable our campaign to reach as many voters as possible. Following the Field Organizers are the County Coordinators who will be tasked with conducting campaign efforts in the numerous counties across America. These efforts will include meetups, phonebanks, and other means of increasing campaign support. To oversee the management of our field operations on the nation level, our National Field Director will work with our top campaign officials to manage field efforts in conjunction with the efforts put forward by the national campaign.</p>
