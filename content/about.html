        <p>Julian Castro, at age 41, is the current U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas.  As the mayor of his hometown, Castro revitalized the local economy and invested considerable amounts of money into the city’s downtown sector. In addition, Castro has strongly invested in local education by promoting cheaper and easier access to educational services across the city which have caused certain statistics like the local high school graduation and college enrollment rates to significantly increase. Recently as Secretary of HUD, Castro has helped spearhead a partnership with Common Sense Media to provide affordable high-speed broadband access to up to 100,000 families in HUD-assisted housing with school-aged children as part of a plan to boost educational outcomes for America’s children. Julian Castro would be a good running mate for Gabe Newell because Castro is young and popular politician who excels at both economic and political management. His expertise as both a mayor and the secretary of HUD would suit him for the vice presidency where he would oversee beneficial legislation to be passed for American citizens. In addition, Castro can provide critical input for presidential actions, especially those dealing with the overall public wellbeing. Combined with the brilliant leadership ideas and skills of Gabe Newell, Julian Castro can use his expertise to effectively work with the administration for the benefit of the country.</p>
